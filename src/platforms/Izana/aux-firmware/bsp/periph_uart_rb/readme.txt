UART Interrupt with Ring Buffers Example
========================================

Example Description
-------------------
The UART example shows how to use the UART in interrupt mode with transmit
and receive ring buffers.

To use the example, connect a serial cable to the board's RS232/UART port and
start a terminal program to monitor the port.  The terminal program on the host
PC should be setup for 115200-8-N-1.
Once the example is started, a brief message is sent to the terminal. Any data
received will be displayed on the terminal.
