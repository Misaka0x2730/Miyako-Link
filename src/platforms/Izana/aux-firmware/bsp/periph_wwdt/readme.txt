Windowed Watchdog Timer (WWDT) Example
======================================

Example description
The WWDT example demonstrates the handling of WDT warning trigger interrupt
to enable "safe" operation. The watchdog generates a warning WWDT interrupt
and then feeds the WWDT on the warning. The LED0 will toggle on each warning
interval cycle.
